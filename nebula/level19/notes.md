In this level we're going to exploit an orphan process and its reclamation process.  When a parent of a child process terminates, the child process stays alive and becomes an orphan process.  This orphan process is automatically reclaimed by an init process.

So we want to fork off a process and kill the parent before it calls flag19.  Then, when it goes to stat the process, it will stat init instead of us thereby assuming the role of root.
